# MyFlix Client Application

### Overview

This is the client-side application for MyFlix, a web application that allows users to browse movies, view movie details, manage their profiles, and maintain a list of their favorite movies. This React-based **single-page application** provides a responsive, user-friendly interface (styled with **Bootstrap**) and interacts with a separate backend **RESTful API** (Node.js/Express) to manage data and user authentication.

### Features

**Movie Browsing:**

* Displays a list of movies, fetched from the backend API.
* Each movie is presented as a "MovieCard" with key details.

**Movie Details:**

* Provides a dedicated "MovieView" page accessible via a link from the "MovieCard".
* Displays comprehensive information about a selected movie.

**User Authentication:**

* **Login:** Existing users can log in using their username and password.
    * Upon successful login, the application receives a JWT token from the backend, which is stored in local storage for subsequent authenticated requests.
* **Sign Up:** New users can register by providing a username, password, email, and date of birth.
* **Logout:** Users can log out, which clears their authentication token from local storage.

**User Profile:**

* Users can access their profile page ("ProfileView").
* Displays user information.
* Allows users to update their information (username, password, email, date of birth).

**Favorite Movies:**

* Users can add movies to their list of favorites.
* Users can remove movies from their list of favorites.
* The favorite movies list is persisted via the backend API.

**Search:**

* Users can search for movies by title.

### Redux Architecture

The application uses Redux for state management. Here's a breakdown:

* **Store:** The Redux store is configured in `redux/store.js`.
* **Reducers and Actions:** Movie data is managed by a reducer and actions defined in `redux/moviesSlice.js`. This uses Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` for efficient reducer and action creation.
* **Component Connection:** Components like `MainView` use `useDispatch` to dispatch actions (e.g., fetching movie data) and `useSelector` to access data from the Redux store.

This architecture ensures a centralized and predictable way to manage the application's data.

---

### Technical Details

* **React:** The application is built using **React.js**.
* **React Router:** Uses React Router for navigation between different views.
* **React Bootstrap:** Uses React Bootstrap for styling and layout.
* **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Uses `fetch` to make API requests to the backend.
* **Local Storage:** Stores the user's JWT token for maintaining authenticated sessions.
* **Redux:** Uses Redux Toolkit for global state management.

### Component Structure

* **MainView:** The main component that orchestrates the application, handling routing, state management, and rendering of different views.
* **MovieCard:** Displays a single movie's information in a card format.
* **MovieView:** Displays detailed information about a selected movie.
* **LoginView:** Handles user login.
* **SignupView:** Handles user registration.
* **NavigationBar:** Displays the navigation bar.
* **ProfileView:** Displays and manages the user's profile.
* **MovieSearch:** Handles the movie search functionality.

### Interaction with Backend API

This client-side application relies on a separate backend API to provide the following functionalities:

* `GET /movies`: Retrieves a list of all movies.
* `GET /movies/:id`: Retrieves a specific movie by ID.
* `POST /users`: Registers a new user.
* `POST /login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
* `GET /users/:username`: Retrieves a user's information.
* `PUT /users/:username`: Updates a user's information.
* `PUT /users/:username/movies/:movieId`: Adds a movie to a user's list of favorite movies.
* `DELETE /users/:username/movies/:movieId`: Removes a movie from a user's list of favorite movies.

### Prerequisites

* **Backend API:** This application requires a running instance of the MyFlix backend API. Ensure that the API is set up and accessible before running the client.
* **Node.js and npm:** Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are required to install dependencies and run the application.

---

### Important Considerations

* **API Endpoint:** The application is configured to communicate with the backend API at https://secret-eyrie-53650-99dc45662f12.herokuapp.com/. Ensure that this endpoint is correct and that the API is running at that location.
* **Error Handling:** The application includes basic error handling for API requests (e.g., displaying error messages).
* **Security:** This application stores the JWT token in local storage.
